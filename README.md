# hypricing

My Hyprland Ricing dotfiles repo, where I store multiple dotfiles for multiples ricing themes specifically for Hyprland (on Arch)

These scripts will only be used after Hyprland is installed through archinstall

**On Arch ISO**:

```bash
pacman -Sy

pacman-key --init

pacman -S archinstall

archinstall
```
